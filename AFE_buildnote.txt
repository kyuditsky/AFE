revisiting pcb2-8
	& headers between
	see 01/23/25		#ESW-106-12-G-D


JLCPCB standard pcb thickness = 1.6mm

space between each:

pcb1-2	3,55mm
pcb2-3	3,45
pcb3-4	3,45
pcb4-5	3.45		#if blackpill is socketed, void pcb5-8
pcb5-6	3,45
pcb6-7	0,95
pcb7-8	-0.3		#pcb7&8 cannot co-exist
pcb8-9	1.25		#pcb9 replaces fitted cover


>>>pcb1 edge dimensions are incorrect
	edge cutouts in middle are too deep
	HBUS connector is in the wrong spot
>>fixed hbus placement
	did not change edgecuts
	current edge cut and drawing differ 0,45mm	
		#radius of curve 1,2mm but edges are 0,75mm offset
		#hbus location callout uses the 0,75mm line

considering shifting intrapcb connector to the left	#implemented
	reasoning: allows for pcb 2 to be installed (cutout is close to mounting fin ~1.5mm)

added pcb5-7 with kludge and copper pours
added kludge to other pcbs

added silkscreen on pcb9

PCBs arrived, Parts arrived
putting it together:

pcb8 does not fully lock into bottom case
	top base needs a support remove as well
	*use pcb7 instead (may still need to remove support
	pcb8 gnd plane net is wrong

overall, edgecuts are correct

c1-2 are 0402?		#my bad
	footprint is 0603

the intrapcb connectors looks good
make cutout in pcb2,3 larger, but fits for now

U4, solidstate relay, just barely fits under pcb2

typical female 2.54mm header, from pcb1 to pcb3, stacks directly underpcb3

	pcb3-pcb5 approximately the same thing
	could probably use pcb1, 3, & 5 for a 3 board arrangement
